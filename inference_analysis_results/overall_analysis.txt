AR-GSE INFERENCE ANALYSIS - OVERALL SUMMARY
============================================================

EXPLANATION OF TERMS:
- True Label: Ground truth class
- Predicted: Model's prediction (mixture of experts)
- 'Pred Wrong': Prediction ≠ True Label (prediction error)
- 'Pred Correct': Prediction = True Label (correct prediction)
- Decision ACCEPT: Model confident, accepts prediction
- Decision REJECT: Model uncertain, rejects prediction

DECISION QUALITY ANALYSIS:
✓ GOOD DECISIONS:
  - Accept + Pred Correct: High confidence, correct prediction
  - Reject + Pred Wrong: Low confidence, avoided wrong prediction
✗ BAD DECISIONS:
  - Accept + Pred Wrong: High confidence, but wrong prediction
  - Reject + Pred Correct: Low confidence, missed correct prediction

KEY INSIGHTS FROM VISUALIZATIONS:
1. Expert Posteriors: Shows how each expert (CE, LogitAdj, BalSoftmax) 
   assigns probabilities across all 100 classes
2. Gating Weights: Shows which expert the model trusts most
3. Mixture Distribution: Final probabilities after expert combination
4. Decision Process: Margin calculation leading to accept/reject
