# Understanding "Reweighting" in Long-Tail Learning

## 🎯 Your Question: What Does "Reweight" Mean?

When papers say **"we re-weight the samples in the original test set to replicate the same label proportions as the training set"**, they typically mean **one of two things**:

### Interpretation 1: Physical Sample Replication (What We Implemented)
- Actually **duplicate samples** to match train distribution
- Test set physically contains more head class samples, fewer tail samples
- Evaluation is done on this replicated test set

### Interpretation 2: Metric Reweighting (Alternative Approach)
- Keep test set **balanced** (all unique samples)
- Apply **weighted metrics** during evaluation
- Weight each sample by its class frequency from training

**Both are valid**, but they serve different purposes!

## 📊 Current Implementation Analysis

### What We Created (5 Splits Total)

| Split | Purpose | Size | IF | Method | Duplication |
|-------|---------|------|-----|--------|-------------|
| **Train** | Train experts | 10,847 | 100 | LT sampling | N/A |
| **Val-LT** | Plugin optimization | 2,169 | 100 | Replication | 1.08x |
| **TuneV-LT** | Gating training | 2,169 | 100 | Replication | 1.45x |
| **Test-LT** | Main evaluation | 10,847 | 100 | Replication | 1.67x |
| **Test-Balanced** | Robustness check | 6,500 | 1.0 | All unique | 1.00x |

### How Each Split is "Reweighted"

#### 1. **Train** - Long-Tail Sampling (No Reweighting)
```
Original CIFAR-100 train: 500 per class (balanced)
→ Sample with exponential decay: 500 (class 0) to 5 (class 99)
Result: True long-tail distribution
```

#### 2. **Val-LT** - Replication from 2,000 Base
```
Base: 20 samples per class (balanced, 2,000 total)
→ Replicate to match train proportions

Class 0 (head, train=500):
  Target: 500 * 0.20 = 100 samples
  Base: 20 samples
  Action: Replicate 5x → use 100 samples (20 unique repeated)

Class 99 (tail, train=5):
  Target: 5 * 0.20 = 1 sample
  Base: 20 samples
  Action: Sample 1 out of 20 → use 1 unique sample

Result: 2,169 samples, IF=100, but only 2,000 unique images
```

#### 3. **TuneV-LT** - Replication from 1,500 Base
```
Base: 15 samples per class (balanced, 1,500 total)
→ Replicate to match train proportions (scale=0.20)

Class 0: 15 base → replicate to 100 (6.7x duplication)
Class 99: 15 base → sample 1 (downsample)

Result: 2,169 samples, IF=100, 1,500 unique images (1.45x avg duplication)
```

#### 4. **Test-LT** - Replication from 6,500 Base  
```
Base: 65 samples per class (balanced, 6,500 total)
→ Replicate to match train proportions (scale=1.0 = 100% of train size)

Class 0 (train=500):
  Target: 500 * 1.0 = 500 samples
  Base: 65 samples
  Action: Replicate 7.7x → use 500 (65 unique repeated ~8 times)

Class 50 (train=48):
  Target: 48 * 1.0 = 48 samples
  Base: 65 samples
  Action: Sample 48 out of 65 → use 48 unique

Class 99 (train=5):
  Target: 5 * 1.0 = 5 samples
  Base: 65 samples
  Action: Sample 5 out of 65 → use 5 unique

Result: 10,847 samples, IF=100, 6,500 unique images (1.67x avg duplication)
```

#### 5. **Test-Balanced** - No Reweighting
```
Base: 65 samples per class (balanced, 6,500 total)
→ Keep as-is, no replication

All 100 classes: 65 samples each
Result: 6,500 samples, IF=1.0, 6,500 unique images (1.00x = no duplication)
```

## ✅ Recommended Approach for Your Research

### **Main Pipeline: Use LT Splits**

For comparing with "Learning to Reject Meets Long-tail Learning":

```python
# Create with balanced test for additional analysis
create_full_cifar100_lt_splits(create_balanced_test=True)
```

**Use these splits:**
- **Training:** `train_indices.json` (10,847, LT)
- **Gating training:** `tuneV_indices.json` (2,169, LT)
- **Optimization:** `val_lt_indices.json` (2,169, LT)
- **Main evaluation:** `test_lt_indices.json` (10,847, LT) ← **Use this for paper comparison**

### **Additional Analysis: Use Balanced Test**

For robustness checks and ablation studies:

- **Alternative evaluation:** `test_balanced_indices.json` (6,500, balanced)
- Reports both LT and balanced metrics
- Shows method's robustness across distributions

## 📈 Specific Mechanism for Each Split

### Val-LT & TuneV-LT (Training/Optimization Splits)
**Purpose:** Learn to handle real-world LT distribution

**Mechanism:**
1. Start with small balanced base (15-20 per class)
2. **Replicate head classes** (need >base samples)
3. **Downsample tail classes** (need <base samples)
4. Net effect: Mix of replication (head) + sampling (tail)

**Why it's OK:**
- ✓ Maintains IF=100 (exact proportions)
- ✓ Optimization sees realistic LT distribution
- ✓ Small size OK (just for training gating/tuning hyperparameters)

### Test-LT (Main Evaluation)
**Purpose:** Evaluate on deployment-realistic distribution

**Mechanism:**
1. Start with large balanced base (65 per class = 6,500 total)
2. Scale to **100% of train size** (10,847 samples)
3. **Replicate head classes** significantly (500 → 65 base = 7.7x)
4. **Downsample tail classes** moderately (5 → 65 base)
5. Net effect: **1.67x avg duplication**, but exact LT proportions

**Why it's OK:**
- ✓ Matches train distribution exactly (IF=100)
- ✓ Large enough for reliable metrics (10,847 samples)
- ✓ Uses 100% of available base samples efficiently
- ✓ Follows paper methodology (reweight to match train)

**Trade-off:**
- Head classes: heavily duplicated (same image repeated)
- Tail classes: good diversity (only 5 out of 65 used)
- This is **intentional** - mirrors real-world LT scenarios!

### Test-Balanced (Robustness Check)
**Purpose:** Verify method works on balanced distribution

**Mechanism:**
1. Use all 6,500 base samples as-is
2. 65 unique samples per class
3. No duplication, no downsampling

**Why it's useful:**
- ✓ Maximum unique samples for tail classes
- ✓ Can compute metrics on balanced distribution
- ✓ Shows if method overfits to LT

---

## 🔬 Scientific Justification

### Why Replicate + Downsample is OK

**From Long-Tail Learning Perspective:**

1. **Matches real deployment:**
   - In production, you **will** see more head class samples
   - Seeing the same head image multiple times is realistic
   - Tail classes are rare by definition

2. **Fair comparison with papers:**
   - Papers use LT test sets to measure real-world performance
   - Methods should work on the actual distribution they'll face

3. **Evaluation is about expectations:**
   - Error rate on LT test = expected error in deployment
   - This expectation accounts for class frequency

### Why We Also Keep Balanced Test

**From Robustness Perspective:**

1. **Ablation study:** Does method work on balanced data too?
2. **Tail performance:** Can see per-class metrics without duplication bias
3. **Flexibility:** Can report both LT and balanced metrics

## 🎯 Summary: How Each Split is "Reweighted"

| Split | Base Samples | Reweighting Method | Result |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Val-LT** | 2,000 (20/class) | Replicate to 20% of train | 2,169, IF=100, 1.08x dup |
| **TuneV-LT** | 1,500 (15/class) | Replicate to 20% of train | 2,169, IF=100, 1.45x dup |
| **Test-LT** | 6,500 (65/class) | Replicate to 100% of train | 10,847, IF=100, 1.67x dup |
| **Test-Bal** | 6,500 (65/class) | No reweighting (keep balanced) | 6,500, IF=1.0, 1.00x dup |

### The Key Insight

"Reweighting" = **Adjust sample counts per class** to match training distribution

- **Not just metric weighting** (though that's an alternative)
- **Physical sample replication** for head classes
- **Downsampling** for tail classes (when base > target)
- Result: Test distribution mirrors real-world deployment

### Is This Standard Practice?

**YES!** Many long-tail papers do this:
- CIFAR-100-LT benchmarks typically have LT test sets
- "Learning to Reject Meets Long-tail Learning" explicitly does this
- It's the most realistic evaluation for deployment scenarios
